# Hi, I'm Kirsten ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at Dartmouth ('25), passionate about solving problems and creating random things.

Check out my personal website and portfolio here: [madebymayland.com](https://madebymayland.com/)

Some things I've been worked on in the past that aren't in my public repos:
- ðŸŽ® **Game Development**: Lead developer of a private Unity/C# video game project, focused on fast-paced action and intuitive, pick-up-and-play controls.
- ðŸ§© **CS10 Sudoku Solver**: Built a Sudoku puzzle creator and solver from scratch in C as a part of a 4-person team, emphasizing efficient backtracking algorithms and dynamic puzzle generation.
- ðŸ’» **Side Projects**: I love exploring random coding challenges â€” from dipping into front end to building a geopolitical forecasting bot.
